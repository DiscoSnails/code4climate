# WELCOME!
This is the gathering place for the **Code for Climate 2023**

## What is Code for Climate?
Interested in learning to code? Curious about our local air quality? Participants in Code for Climate will gain hands-on experience with programming basics and will write their own code to analyze data using Python. After five days, students will have written a program to explore, analyze and visualize Milwaukee air quality data!
This program is a good fit for any high schooler interested in engineering, especially those interested in learning to code. 

This is organized at Marquette University, Milwaukee from 24 - 28 July 2023
