## Few things before we start
This file and the README file and many other files in this repository will be written using _markdown_. You can think markdown as a simple text-based tool to organize thoughts!

It is recommended that you try using markdown yourself, too. At least for this program. And see if you like it.

To get you started, [here's a cheatsheet on Markdown (md)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


## Notes for the Day
 - Typing things here to make it look like i am doing something.

 - Did some more things
     - print ('Hello World')
     - print('This is Ash! How are you?')

     - print ('Hello World')
     - print('This is Ash! How are you?')

     - name = input('Can I have your name? ')
     - print('Thank you for your name.')

     - print('You: What is your name?')
     - print('My name is', name)

     - age = input('Can I have your years? ')
     - print('Thank you for your years.')

     - print('You: How many years do you have?')
